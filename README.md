# Java Web JSP Project Configuration with Tomcat 8, SQL Server, and JSON

This example project demonstrates how to configure a Java Web project using JSP as the presentation technology, Tomcat 8 as the application server, SQL Server as the database, and JSON as the data exchange format on the front-end.

## Prerequisites

- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your system.
- Apache Tomcat 8 or a later version installed on your system.
- SQL Server installed and configured.
- Additional JAR libraries for JSON Simple and the SQL Server JDBC driver.

## Project Configuration

1. Clone or download the project from the repository.

2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., NetBeans, Eclipse).

3. Tomcat Configuration:
   - Make sure Tomcat is installed and properly configured in your IDE.
   - Add the Tomcat server to your IDE and configure it to use version 8 or later.

4. Database Configuration:
   - Create a database in SQL Server for the project.
   - Update the connection URL in the JSP and Java files according to your SQL Server configurations.

5. JAR Libraries:
   - Ensure that you have the necessary JAR libraries in your project.
   - Add the `json-simple-x.x.x.jar` library to your project to work with JSON.
   - Add the SQL Server JDBC driver to your project to access the database.

6. Deployment and Execution:
   - Deploy the project to your Tomcat server.
   - Start the Tomcat server and access the project URL in your web browser.

7. Verify Functionality:
   - Verify that you can access the JSP pages and perform the expected operations.

## Project Structure

The project follows a basic structure:

- `WebContent`: Contains the JSP files and web resources (CSS, images, etc.).
- `src`: Contains the Java source files.
- `lib`: Contains the additional JAR libraries.
